    <div id="about-me">
        <p> I am Kalia. I was born in Toronto, Canada to two parents from the island of St.Vincent & the Grenadines.</p>
<p>I spent some of my early years living in Brooklyn, New York the home of my father. I tend to visit often & would even consider it to be my second home.</p> 
<p>Growing up I wanted to be a doctor, but later came to the realization that this career path was not for me.</p>
<p>All my life i've grown a love for the beauty in life, and seeked making everything around me look and feel beautiful, which pushed me into esthetics. However, through running my beauty business, I realized that I found happiness in also making beautiful content, videos and websites. This is how I became interested and immersed in the world of tech. Through seeing what I am capable of on my own, I can only wonder the things i'd be able to create with the assistance of this program. </p>   </div>
